I believe that digital innovation is about improving on existing ideas using technology in order to provide benefit to the world. We are always reading about the development of new technologies, and digital innovation is at the heart of each one. Virtual reality is one area where digital innovation has occurred, with companies such as Meta investing millions into its development.

Further researching this topic, I've found out that digital innovation involves companies optimising their business experience for the customer to produce better targets [1]. Tackling improvements step by step ensures that the users can easily adjust to changes in the experience and it keeps bugs and errors down to a minimum as they can be addressed at each interval.

Converting a manual process to a digital process is digital innovation [2]. Performing tasks by hand are more expensive and time-consuming than having digital processes due to requiring many humans and salaries. The only way a business can stay at the top in modern society is by implementing digital innovation wherever possible.

You can collect statistical data in order to gain better insights into how customers interact with your product. You can use data such as the most searched-for item on the site to personalise recommendations for users. Improvements to supply chains can reduce manufacturing costs. For example, you could create an algorithm that checks the price of materials from a database of different suppliers and buy from the one that costs the cheapest.

I want to improve my writing and analytical skills as I believe these are essential skills that everyone should have. I also hope to learn how to become a well-rounded blog writer. Writing documentation and articles about how to use programs are common in computer science and I am looking forward to gaining the experience.

I have always wanted to start my own business and I feel that the group project will give me a glimpse into how to design and market a product, while also learning how to build the business from the ground up.
