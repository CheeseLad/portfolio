The blog that I enjoy reading is written by Chris Titus and can be found at www.christitus.com [1]. The blog is updated multiple times a week and covers a wide range of technology topics.

I enjoy seeing that comments are allowed on the blog, as many modern blogs disable this feature due to the rise of toxicity on the internet. It allows me to ask questions on the topic discussed, and I can help others if they run into an issue that I can solve. My favourite aspect is how the articles are laid out and how the instructions in the tutorials are separated in order to make them clear and legible, a “copy” button is also provided for quickly inputting commands into a terminal.

I would categorise it as a technology blog focusing on operating systems and networking. To give users easy access to the different categories, a navigation bar is provided and the categories can be found in the “Sections” tab. These categories include operating systems such as Android, Linux, Windows and MacOS, along with a category for networking. Clicking any of these options will filter through the articles, showing only posts that are related to that category.

Examples of Linux-related content include [2] modifying games on a Steam Deck (a handheld device running Linux) and his switching to Ubuntu article [3], where Chris discusses his reasons for the switch, as well as all the tweaks he has performed to optimise the operating system. Many articles like these exist on the blog and are well-written and engaging.

The main focus of the blog is to educate users on a wide range of technologies while keeping it easily understandable. While some of the blog posts may attract the tech enthusiast demographic such as how to configure Windows to be more efficient and use fewer resources, many are focused on technology in general. The format of each post is a written article with details provided, along with a supplementary walkthrough video.
